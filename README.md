# Tic-Tac-Toe-System

_Project Overview_

This is a distributed Tic-Tac-Toe gaming system using Java. This system not only allows multiple players to connect and play 
but also facilitate real-time chatting between players. The game features a graphical user interface (GUI) for the client.

_Game Rules_

In the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, two players take turns marking an empty square on a 3x3 grid with either ‘X’ or
‘O’. The primary objective is to get three of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, to
claim victory. If all the squares on the grid are filled, and no player has achieved a winning pattern, the game is
considered a draw.

_How to Run_

Two executable jar files can be found inside the file folders, one for the client and one for the server. 
The executable jar files should run the following way.
`java -jar server.jar ip port`

`java -jar client.jar username server_ip server_port`
