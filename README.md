#Read Me

This Repo has 2 mini games written in Java.
A random object is created in a 1D space, and player is prompted to guess the object's location.
When the guess is correct, player will get a "hit" message. If incorrect, then a "miss" message.
When all locations of the object is "hitted", player win and the number of guesses are displayed.

The difference between the two games are:
- HitMeIfYouCan is using Array
- Hit2 is using ArrayList
